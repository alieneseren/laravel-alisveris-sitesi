Subject: Laravel PHP Project Migration - Not WordPress

Dear Support Team,

I need to clarify that this is NOT a WordPress website. This is a **Laravel PHP Framework** project which requires different migration process.

**Project Details:**
- Framework: Laravel 12.20.0 (PHP Framework)
- Database: MySQL
- Type: Custom E-commerce Platform
- NOT WordPress - NO WordPress migration tools needed

**Migration Requirements:**
1. PHP 8.1+ support
2. MySQL database import
3. Manual file upload to web root
4. Composer dependencies installation
5. Laravel-specific configurations

**Files Included:**
✅ Complete Laravel project files
✅ Database dump (.sql file)
✅ Upload folder with all images
✅ Production configuration files
✅ Migration instructions (HOSTING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**What I Need:**
1. Upload all project files to hosting
2. Import MySQL database
3. Configure .env file with hosting details
4. Set proper folder permissions
5. Run Laravel optimization commands

This is a custom PHP application, not WordPress. Please use manual migration process instead of WordPress migration tools.

I've included detailed migration instructions in HOSTING_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md file.

Please let me know if you need any clarification about Laravel framework migration.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
